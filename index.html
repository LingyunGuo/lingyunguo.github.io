        <h1 id="name" class="badScript"><span>Hi, I'm</span> Lingyun Guo</h1>
        <p>A studnet from <span class="badScript"> University of Waterloo, Canada</span>, <br />with major Software Engineering,
            currently in 2B term.</p><br />
        <hr>
        <div class="subSection">

            <p>My father was a software engineer when I was a kid, and I figure that might be 50% of the reason that I chose
                <span class="badScript">software</span> as my major. As for the other 50%, I believe it's that I cannot tolerate
                all those ugly and nasty webpages, mobile apps and softwares that hurts my eyes when I look at them. I wanna
                build my own ones, so that their designs can follow my likes and get rid of my dislikes.</p>
            <p>Now I'm sitting in a CS lecture, listenning profs talking about data structures and algorithms, and finally realize
                that what I wanna do is actually the job for UI designers.</p>
            <p>However, I still <span class="badScript">LOVE</span> my major.</p>
            <p>Building small games that I was keen on during my childhood,</p>
            <p>Write small scripts to do the calculation for my assignments,</p>
            <p>Creating webpages and throwing tons of fancy animations into them,</p>
            <p>Watching 0's and 1's lined up and becoming something that makes sence,</p>
            <p>...</p>
            <p>These are just tiny things that one can do by programming, while they make me feel SO good.</p>
            <p>Plus, this provides me another solution for dumping those nasty UI designs, the <span class="badScript">Command Line</span>.</p>

        <div class="subSection">
            <p>During my time in UWaterloo,I learned <span class="badScript">C, C++, Python, JavaScript</span>, etc, </p>
            <p>And more importantly, data structures, algorithms, programming principles.</p>
            <p>I participated in a couple projects, one of my favourite is a <a href="/tetris">tetris HTML game</a>. This may
                sounds like bragging myself, but to me, it looks beautiful.</p>
            <p>I also did two internships, in Toronto as Web Developer and in Cambridge as Application Developer. I love these
                interns. </p>
            <p>I learned tons of stuff, got my hands on the cool and advanced techniques, familiarized myself with the industry
                and coded A LOT.</p>
            <p>That's exactly what I came to UWaterloo for.</p>

            <p>As you can probably tell from my name, I'm a Chinese.</p>
            <p>I speak <span class="badScript">Chinese</span> and <span class="badScript">Hokkien</span> as my mother tongue,
                <span class="badScript">English</span> as my third language, while I just start learning <span class="JP">Japanese</span>                and
                <span class="GER">German</span> as well.</p>
            <p>I still wanna learn more, any suggestions?</p>

            <p>Besides working and studying, I'm a big fan of travelling.</p>
            <p>When I lived in my hometown, I travelled to more than 20 provinces in China.</p>
            <p>I've also been to <span class="badScript">Britain, Cambodia, Russia</span>, and now I'm here in &#127809;
                <span class="badScript">Canada</span>.</p>
            <p>I'm dreaming of visiting <span class="badScript">Japan</span>, but don't really have time ( and MONEY ) to do
                so.
            </p>
            <p>It's when travelling that I can actually feel the broadness of this world and the insignificance of myself.</p>
